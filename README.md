# Recipe-App
Osama's Recipe Book
This is a simple web application that allows users to search for recipes based on the name of a dish. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and fetches data from the MealDB API.

# Project Structure
 The project is organized into three main files:
  index.html - The main HTML document. Contains the markup for the search input, search button, and the area where   the fetched data will be displayed.
  style.css - Contains the CSS styles for the project.
  script.js - Contains the JavaScript code that fetches and displays the recipe data from the API.

# Features
User-friendly interface for searching recipes.
Fetches data from a reliable recipe API (MealDB).
Displays recipe details including name, origin, ingredients, and cooking instructions.
Responsive design.

# Usage
To use this web app, simply type the name of a dish into the search bar and click the "Search" button. The application will fetch data related to your search query and display it in a structured format on the webpage.

# Installation and Setup
Clone the repository or download the code.

Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

# Usage and Interaction Guide
Here's how you can use and interact with the web app:
Searching for a Recipe: To search for a recipe, input the name of a dish into the search bar located at the top of the page. Press the "Search" button to submit your query.
Viewing a Recipe: Once you've submitted a search, the app will display the first match it finds. The resulting display includes a picture of the dish, the dish's name, its origin, and a list of ingredients used to prepare it.
Accessing Cooking Instructions: To view the cooking instructions for a dish, click on the "View Recipe" button. This will reveal a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to prepare the dish.

# Error Handling
The app has been designed to handle errors gracefully. If the search input is empty, it will prompt you to enter a dish name. Similarly, if you enter a dish name that doesn't exist in the database, the app will let you know that the input was invalid.

# Future Improvements
We are always striving to make our app better. If you have any suggestions or feature requests, please feel free to open an issue. We would love to hear your ideas!
